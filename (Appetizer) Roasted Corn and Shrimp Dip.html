<h1>Appetizer: Roasted Corn and Shrimp Dip</h1>
3/4 lb shrimp
<div>1/2 cup sour cream</div>
<div>1/2 cup mayo</div>
<div>1/4 cup red onion, minced</div>
<div>1/2 cup green onion, minced</div>

<div>3 ears roasted corn, cut from ears after roasting</div>

<div>Boil the shrimp in crab boil or I had the market steam it for me in old bay. ?Place shrimp in fridge to chill. Roughly chop the shrimp. Combine the shrimp with the remaining ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix well. ?Refrigerate the dip for 1-2 hours before serving. ?Serve with your favorite chips or crackers for dipping.?</div>

<div>I made this for a ladies get together at Watercolor on Feb. 26, 2009. ?I made it the night before. ?Bri and I tasted it shortly after I made it and then again the next day at lunchtime. ?We both thought the flavors were so much better the next day. ?Even more of a benefit...you can make it ahead of time. ?I served it with flatbread and it was a keeper. ?Will make it again....soon....enjoy!</div>
