<h1>Dessert: Ambrosia</h1>
<p>I think we have had Ambrosia for every Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter that I can remember.  I love it and I was so happy when I saw that Mom had written the recipe down for us.  It took her a long time to make because each orange section has to be removed individually.  It was truly a labor of love when she made it.  She would put it in those big ground glass jars and keep it in the fridge.  I love it for breakfast, too.  She also served it with pound cake sometimes.</p>
<p>She always kept a small bowl of grated coconut beside the ambrosia bowl.  She was a purist!!  It was to be added as a topping, not in her ambrosia!   </p>
