<h1>Dessert: Blackberry Cobbler</h1>
<div>Blackberry Cobbler</div>
<div><br/></div>
2 cups self rising flour
<div>2 cups milk</div>
<div>2 cups sugar</div>
<div>1/2 cup butter</div>
<div>3 1/2 cups blackberries</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Preheat oven to 350. Melt butter and pour into the bottom of a 13x9 pan. Stir together flour, milk and sugar. Mixture will be lumpy. Pour into pan on top of melted butter. Do not stir this mixture in with the butter just pour it on top. Then top with blackberries. That is all you do!!! Cook in preheated 350 oven for one hour. Top with vanilla ice cream. Enjoy....can use other fruits. </div>

<div>Brian said this is the best non chocolate dessert I've ever made....I think it is perhaps one of the only non chocolate desserts I've ever made! </div>

<div>Made this at the beach May 4, 2010. Parker and I picked the blackberries and we only had a scant 3 1/2 cups of blackberries because we stopped picking when we saw a snake curled up about 6 inches from Parker...yikes! We found the blackberries when we were on a bike ride. </div>
