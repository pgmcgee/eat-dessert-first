<h1>Dessert: Lanita's Fruit Dip</h1>
<p>This recipe was given to me by a "Navy" friend. Mom loved it (and she loved Lanita) and took it to one of her happy hours in the Villages. When I arrived the next day she had saved some for us to share. She was so happy because she had our "dinner" ready!!! : ) </p>
