<h1>Dessert: Reece Balls</h1>
<p>We've been making these since mom and Ms. Martha made them when mom and dad lived in Jacksonville before we were born.  It was their first Christmas in Jacksonville.  Dad loved them so much we've been making them every Christmas since.</p>

<p>Reece Balls</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1 1/2 sticks butter</p>
<p>2 cups peanut butter</p>
<p>1 box powdered sugar</p>
<p>2 (12 oz.) pkg. chocolate chips</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Melt the butter and add to the peanut butter.  A good trick is to spray the measuring cup with Pam before you measure the peanut butter and it will come out much easier.  Cream the butter and peanut butter together- we've found the easiest way to do it is in the electric mixer.  Then add the powdered sugar.  Roll the mixture into walnut sized balls and place on parchment covered baking sheets.  Place them in the fridge for an hour or two to let them firm up a bit (you could actually make the balls the night before).  Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler.  It is easier to cover them if you let the chocolate cool a little after you melt it.  Dip the peanut butter balls in chocolate, put back on tray and place in the freezer for a few hours until hard.  Store in the freezer until they are all eaten (it won't take too long)!<br/></p>
