<h1>Dessert: Stir and Drop Sugar Cookies</h1>
<p>This is Janette Ray's recipe.  She was a neighbor of Nana's. Nana made these for Parker and Elizabeth. She had a little bucket for each of them. When Nana and Mom would come to Oviedo to see us she would always fill up their buckets with cookies and give it to them when she arrived. They loved them and then when the Batteiger boys were born I can remember her doing the same thing for them. They are wonderful little bland cookies. Easy to make, too!</p>
