<h1>Meat: Best Ever Aged Prime Rib</h1>
<b>Buying the roast: </b> A whole rib roast (aka prime rib) consists of ribs 6 through 12.  When ordering a larger roast ask for ribs 9 through 12 to receive the first cut.  When ordering a slightly smaller roast ask for ribs 10 through 12.

<div><b>Aging the roast:</b>  Buy the roast ahead of time, 3 to 4 days before you plan on roasting it.  When you get the roast home, pat it dry and place it on a wire rack set over a paper towel-lined cake pan or plate.  Set the racked roast in the refrigerator and let it age until you are ready to roast it, up to four days.  Before roasting, shave off any exterior meat that has completely dehydrated.</div>

<div>1. An hour before cooking, remove the roast from the refrigerator to bring it to room temperature. </div>
<div>2. Adjust an over rack to the lowest position and heat the oven to 250 degrees.  Heat a large, heavy-bottomed roasting pan over two burners set at medium-high.  Place the roast in the hot pan and cook on all sides until nicely browned and about 1/2 cup fat has been rendered, 6 to 8 minutes.</div>
<div>3. Remove the roast from the pan.  Set a wire rack in the pan, then set the roast on the rack.  Generously season with salt and pepper to taste.</div>
<div>4. Place the roast in the over and roast until the meat registers 130 degrees (for medium-rare), 3 to 3-1/2 hours.  Remove the roast from the oven and tent with foil.  Let stand 20 to 30 minutes to allow juices to redistribute themselves evenly throughout the roast.</div>
<div>5. Remove the twine and set the roast on a cutting board, rib bones at a 90-degree angle to the board.  Carve and serve immediately.</div>
