<h1>How to create a page for your recipe...</h1>
<p>1) In the New page name: on top, name your page Genre of Food: Name of Recipe</p>
<p>For example, Dessert: White Icing</p>
<p>2) In the text box, first write any stories or memories that you have of when you usually make this recipe or anything about it you want to be included.</p>
<p>3) Write the recipe with ingredients followed by directions.</p>
<p>4) If you have a picture to include, click on the Image button above the text box on the left.  Click Browse and find where the picture is saved on your computer and click Add.  If you don't have a picture now, you can add one later.  If you are having trouble, you can e-mail me your picture and I can add it for you.</p>
<p>5) Now press the Save &amp; Publish button on the bottom left.  On the next screen, it asks you if you want to send everyone an e-mail that you have updated the website.  I would press Skip this Step just so your Inboxes don't get filled with e-mails from the site but it is up to you.</p>
<p>You just added a recipe!</p>
<p>6) If you read someone's recipe and you have a comment like another story you remember or you have a variation of the recipe or something you can go on that page and click on the Add Discussion button at the bottom and you can all comment on the recipes without making permanent changes to the recipe.</p>
<p>7) Let me know if you have any questions or are having any problems. My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:elizabeth,mcgee1@gmail.com">elizabeth,mcgee1@gmail.com</a>. </p>
