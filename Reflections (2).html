<h1>Reflections (2)</h1>
<p>This prayer was found in Mom's things.  Her handwriting changed over the years.  It is written in an earlier time when her writing was much larger than her later years.  I found it fascinating because it is an Indian prayer.  She had a huge fear of the Seminoles!  She never wanted to go on their reservation.  She must have been participating in a Sunday School class because a second piece of paper recorded:  Matt. 6: 28-29 Read over for next Sun. </p>

<p>O Thou, by whose mercy we have all been spared through the week that is passed, Thy children draw nigh to worship Thee with gladness.  It is the day which thou hast set aside for worship; assist us to rejoice in it and be glad.</p>

<p>us</p>
<p>Ripen in our daily lives Thou blessed fruits - love, joy, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance;  so shall we become day by day more and more like Jesus, until we see him as he is, and be changed into his perfect likeness.  Hear us and help us, O blessed spirit, whom with the Father and the Son together we worship and glorify as one God. <br/></p>
