<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>Mom wrote this on the back of a lime green sheet of paper on which she had partially written Marie Zachary's recipe for Chicken Pie.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She wrote that it is a quote from Aunt Grace's husband.  Aunt Grace is 80 years old.  (This saying was not dated but had to be from the St. Pete era.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The past is history,</p>
<p>the future is mystery,</p>
<p>and the present is a gift.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's why it's called the present!! </p>
